                Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New
                Orleans!

                Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves
                with
                long
                beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                their
                families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on
                the
                ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On
                Mardi
                Gras
                day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.

                Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                trinkets
                they will catch from the parades!

                Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed.

            <div class="about-text">
                The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the
                17th
                and
                18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                Gras,"
                or
                fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.

                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                plot
                of
                ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
                realized
                it
                was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which
                is
                now
                Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very
                first
                Mardi Gras.

                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current
                Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
                from
                1711
                through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men.
                Later,
                Rex
                would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This
                occurred
                on Fat Tuesday.

                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                New
                Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                Marquis
                de
                Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras
                balls of
                today.

                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing
                body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of
                clubs
                and
                carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.

                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                riders to
                celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members
                and
                lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed
                the
                Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
                brought
                magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls.
                Krewe
                members remained anonymous.

                In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                recorded
                account of Mardi Gras "throws."

                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats
                were
                always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and
                details
                could
                not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these
                chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume
                designs
                of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought
                to
                life
                by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for
                creating
                all
                of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.

                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                first
                daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
                Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for
                justice;
                gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable
                anthem,
                "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.

                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                culminating
                with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
                paper-mache'
                animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
                including
                Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a
                legal
                holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.

                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                social
                clubs
                with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded
                by
                their
                members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

            <div class="about-text">
                The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The
                colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
                selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism.[28][29]

                Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory
                that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
                Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely
                associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus
                avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the
                rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other
                colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[28]

                Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in
                that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as
                purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.

                <div class="about-text">Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to
                    hold the
                    position in the city's history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and
                    Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city.
                    Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent
                    crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
                    use,
                    Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
                    transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018
                    the
                    City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                    Agreement
                    with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50
                    million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual
                    recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New
                    Orleans
                    voters approved three of the four proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the
                    ballot in
                    the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term
                    rental
                    properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home
                    Rule
                    Charter.
